# ðŸŽ“ Student Mental Health Analyzer Pro

A cutting-edge **Python & Streamlit web app** that predicts student mental health risks using **machine learning** and provides **AI-powered advice**. With lifelike speech output, this project combines **ML models**, **Google Gemini AI**, and **Murf TTS** for a fully interactive experience.

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Project Stands Out

- **Advanced ML Techniques**:  
  The app uses a custom-trained ML model (`AdvancedStudentHealthModel`) to predict **depression risk** and assess confidence in predictions. This allows for personalized and data-driven mental health insights.

- **AI-Powered Advice with Gemini**:  
  Gemini AI analyzes user profiles and ML predictions to provide **actionable, student-friendly recommendations**. This ensures advice is not generic but tailored to the risk level.

- **Lifelike Speech with Murf TTS**:  
  Murf converts Geminiâ€™s textual advice into **natural-sounding speech**, enhancing accessibility and engagement. Over 130 voices and multiple languages allow customization for real-world applications.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:  
  Risk probabilities are visualized using **Plotly pie charts**, making results easy to understand at a glance.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Predicts **Depression Risk**, **Risk Level**, and **Confidence**.
- Provides **Best Model Used** for transparency.
- Displays **actionable AI advice** based on ML prediction.
- Optional **audio advice** using Murf TTS.
- Fully responsive and student-friendly **Streamlit interface**.
